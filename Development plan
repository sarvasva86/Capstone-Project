2. Capstone Steps & Hatchways Submission Workflow

Step 1: Project Proposal Submission (Mentor Approval Required)  
- Submit your project proposal (which you already have) via Hatchways GitHub.  
- Your mentor will provide feedback before proceeding.  

Step 2: Basic App Structure (Mentor Approval Required)  
- Set up the frontend (React, Redux) and backend (Express).  
- Implement authentication (Signup/Login with JWT).  
- Push the basic structure to Hatchways GitHub for mentor review.  

Step 3: Core Features (Hatchways Grader Evaluation)  
- **Frontend:Design an interactive itinerary planner.  
- **Backend: CRUD API for itinerary management.  
- **API Integration: Google Maps (geolocation, directions) & OpenWeatherMap.  

Step 4: Advanced Features (Hatchways Grader Evaluation) 
- Implement Redux for global state management (if applicable).  
- Introduce **user preferences for personalized recommendations.  
- Optimize API calls with caching strategies.  

Step 5: Final Enhancements (Hatchways Grader Evaluation) 
- Add responsive UI for mobile/tablets.  
- Implement security measures (JWT, data encryption).  
- Deploy on Heroku and share the live link.  

Step 6: Project Submission & Review (Hatchways Grader Evaluation)  
- Final review by Hatchways graders.  
- Make improvements based on feedback.
